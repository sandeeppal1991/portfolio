Games of Berkeley is one of the oldest tabletop game stores in the Bay Area. After three decades in downtown Berkeley, the store planned to move to a new location closer to the Cal campus, and was seeking marketing strategies to attract new customers while keeping old ones. In particular, the store wanted to brand itself as community hangout, with a gathering space and a full range of gaming events.We designed a marketing campaign that included posters, folded-paper “fortune-teller”, and deck of playing cards to help transform the brand of the store. Our design targeted Cal students as the primary user group.We won the First-place prize and “Illustration Wizard” award for the best-quality designs, 2016 CMYK Designathon, UC Berkeley.My Team included others from the Ischool,UC Berkeley: Yifei Liu, Safei Gu, Michelle Carney, Prateek Nadagouda, Liz Lee"

This is a family owned business, where quality and excellence make the difference completing any project. Our attention to detail and our love for the trade quickly established us as a favorite amongst many high end home builders. In the past decade we have completed thousands of projects across the GTA, each one uniquely designed and built for the home owner. Great design is the first step to beautifully functional cabinetry. Equally important is the use of premium material, construction method and craftsmanship. At EFC Kitchens all of our cabinetry is completely custom made utilizing only the finest material and the greatest attention to detail. Industry leading European hardware manufacturers such as Blum, Hafele, and Grass are used in all of our cabinetry. <br/><b> The primary aim of this project was to redesign the website for EFC Kitchens. Earlier their website was a multi page application. Being a pure informational website, I thought to make a single page application out of it.</b>"

This would reduce the engagement time required by the user with the UX team and the efforts would be greatly minimized.Elements contains web components which can easily be integrated into almost any design. All the components cater to same family of visual design, and thus can be seamlessly integrated into projects, allowing you to create multiple apps. This leads to a drastic save in time and effort. We currently support 27 components ranging from headers, footers to form controls and alerts. These components are heavily modularized so that they can be used as plug n play in multiple configurations to ensure a smooth operation."

Just select your components, add to the package, select supported framework, apply theme and download! Elements is a Self Service User Interface, which means one would not require extensive help from UX Specialists for their needs. This would reduce the engagement time required by the user with the UX team and the efforts would be greatly minimized.Elements contains web components which can easily be integrated into almost any design. All the components cater to same family of visual design, and thus can be seamlessly integrated into projects, allowing you to create multiple apps. This leads to a drastic save in time and effort. We currently support 27 components ranging from headers, footers to form controls and alerts. These components are heavily modularized so that they can be used as plug n play in multiple configurations to ensure a smooth operation."
