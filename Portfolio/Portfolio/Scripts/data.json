This is a family owned business, where quality and excellence make the difference completing any project. Our attention to detail and our love for the trade quickly established us as a favorite amongst many high end home builders. In the past decade we have completed thousands of projects across the GTA, each one uniquely designed and built for the home owner. Great design is the first step to beautifully functional cabinetry. Equally important is the use of premium material, construction method and craftsmanship. At EFC Kitchens all of our cabinetry is completely custom made utilizing only the finest material and the greatest attention to detail. Industry leading European hardware manufacturers such as Blum, Hafele, and Grass are used in all of our cabinetry. <br/><b> The primary aim of this project was to redesign the website for EFC Kitchens. Earlier their website was a multi page application. Being a pure informational website, I thought to make a single page application out of it.</b>"
